## About The App
The Supermarket Management System is a WPF application designed to streamline the operations of a supermarket. Utilizing the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, this application ensures a clean separation of concerns, promoting maintainability and testability. The application leverages the Entity Framework with a Database First approach to interact with the underlying database, providing robust data management capabilities. The database is created by me using Sql Server.
